# Code-Quiz
In this challenge I created a timed Coding Quiz that will portray what I have learned in HTML, CSS, as well as JAVASCRIPT. In this quiz you will see various multiple-choice questions and you have to decide which answer is correct. Coding quizzes are used in various ways such as seeing if an employee is qualified for the job or just to test your own abilities.
